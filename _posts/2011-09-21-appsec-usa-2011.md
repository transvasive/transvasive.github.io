I'll be [speaking](http://2011.appsecusa.org/talks.html#bsm) at [AppSec
USA 2011](http://2011.appsecusa.org/), the national
[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/) conference, tomorrow, 9/22/2011! If
you're here in Minneapolis, come down to the convention center and you
can see me and many other more illustrious speakers. I'll be discussing
*Behavioral Security Modeling*, the first tool to be developed for
Behavioral Information Security.
