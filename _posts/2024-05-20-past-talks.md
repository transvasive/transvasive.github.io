This week I've been looking through and cataloging my past presentations, and found a few older ones that were never posted here or at <https://information-safety.org>.

Here are brief notes and slides from these past talks:

## University of MN

I presented a [version](/assets/intro-bis-carlson-2012-02-13.pdf) of my Behavioral Information Security [talk]({% post_url 2011-06-28-introduction-to-bis %}), tailored for an information security class at the Carlson School of Management, on February 13, 2012.

## ISSA SEAG

On April 16, 2013, I presented a [version](/assets/issa-seag-2013-04-16.pdf) of my Information Safety talk that I originally gave at [SIRAcon]({% post_url 2012-05-07-siracon %}) to the [ISSA](https://mnissa.org) Security Education and Awareness Group, along with the [Information Safety Basics]({% post_url 2012-07-11-information-safety-basics %}) [slides](/assets/information-safety-2013-04-16.pdf) I'd developed.

## Secure360 2013

In May 2013, I gave an updated [version](/assets/btm-s360-20130514.pdf) of the Behavioral Threat Modeling talk I originally gave at the ISC2 Security Congress in [2012]({% post_url 2012-09-10-isc2-security-congress %}).

## Secure360 2017

Finally, I spoke at Secure360 2017 on "Practical Identity Access Management", originally given at [CyberSecureGov]({% post_url 2016-11-21-cybersecuregov-2016 %}). I was later invited to present the talk again at the first (and last) Secure360 conference in Milwaukee, WI in 2018. ([slides](/assets/practical-iam-benninghoff-secure360-2017.pdf))

Newer talks have been posted on <https://information-safety.org>.
