Today I spoke at the [(ISC)2 Security Congress in
Philadelphia](https://web.archive.org/web/20121203213221/https://www.isc2.org/Conferences.aspx), which is
co-located with the [ASIS International
Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20121104064416/http://www.asis2012.org/Pages/Seminar-Home-Page.aspx).
I talked about [Behavioral Threat Modeling]({% post_url 2012-02-08-threat-modeling %}), which
is my proposal for a better way of identifying security design flaws. I
enjoyed the talk, and got several good questions at the end.

Although video of the talk is only available to conference participants,
I've posted a copy of my slides below. For those who would like a copy
of the Excel template I used for the Threat Profiles, I'm working on
posting a copy here as well, but until then, please contact me and I'll
be happy to email you a copy.

If you happen to live in the Minneapolis / St Paul area, I'll be giving
the talk again at the local [OWASP MSP
chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Minneapolis_St_Paul) a week
from today, on September 17. (It's the same talk, we just had a problem
getting the title right) The OWASP MSP group is fun, and I'm hoping I'll
get some hecklers.

Finally, here is a [link to videos of all of the talks at
SIRACon](https://www.societyinforisk.org/posts/2012/Mar/siracon-2012/),
including [the talk I gave on Information Safety]({% post_url 2012-05-07-siracon %}).

**Update:** I've posted both the slides, and the sample threat profiles,
links above.
