I'm pleased to announce three upcoming speaking engagements in 2012!

First, I've been busy working with Karl Brophey on the [Behavioral
Security Modeling]({% post_url 2011-09-26-bsm-presentation %}) whitepaper I promised back in
September 2011 at [OWASP AppSec USA]({% post_url 2011-11-17-appsec-usa-2011-video %}) here in
Minneapolis. Karl has a wealth of experience in software development and
architecture, and we will be publishing the paper and [giving a
presentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20120608025300/http://secure360.org/attendees/workshop-descriptions/#BSM)
at [Secure360](https://secure360.org/) in St Paul on May 8. If you are
going, make sure to register for the [Secure360 Run/Walk for
ECHO](https://secure360.org/secure360-runwalk-for-echo-2/)!

Second, I'll also be speaking the day before (on May 7) at
[SIRACon](https://www.societyinforisk.org/posts/2012/Mar/siracon-2012/),
the first-ever conference of the [Society of Information Risk
Analysts](https://www.societyinforisk.org/), on *"Organizing Risk
Management Programs, or, What I Learned from the Secret Service and the
Aviation Industry,"* where I will make the case for splitting up risk
management into two separate functions: information protection (like the
Secret Service), and information safety (like the airline industry).
While I'm excited to be speaking, I'm even more exited to see the other
talks, given by Risk Management thought leaders from around the country.

Finally, I just learned today that my proposal for the [ISC2 Security
Congress](https://web.archive.org/web/20121203213221/https://www.isc2.org/Conferences.aspx) in Philadelphia was
accepted, and I'll be speaking on September 10 on *"Defending Against
Attacks by Modeling Threat Behaviors,"* which will demonstrate how
knowledge of attacker behaviors can be used to evaluate and improve
application and infrastructure design. It's my attempt to improve upon
[traditional threat modeling]({% post_url 2012-02-08-threat-modeling %}). The ISC Security
Congress is co-located with the [ASIS International
conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20121104064416/http://www.asis2012.org/Pages/Seminar-Home-Page.aspx), and I'm looking forward to
attending talks from the world of physical security.
