I spoke yesterday at the [local (Minnesota) chapter of
ISSA](https://mnissa.org), as a last-minute replacement for David
Bryan. I want to thank MN ISSA for the opportunity to speak, I thought
the talk generated some good discussion. Here are the slides from the
talk, they're an updated version of what I posted in June.

[Behavioral Information Security: An Introduction](/assets/bis-issa-20111115.pdf)

I also want to thank Kevin Flanagan from RSA for his excellent talk on
the RSA breach. For me, it served as a reminder on the critical security
controls needed to protect against attacks, both sophisticated and
unsophisticated. It was telling that most of the things on his summary
of critical security controls were already in existence 10 years ago.

**Updated:** MN ISSA has posted [a video of my talk](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/18541162)
