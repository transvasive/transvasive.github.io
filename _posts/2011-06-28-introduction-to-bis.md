I recently gave an early version of my presentation on Behavioral
Information Security to a local security group here in Minneapolis. By
request, I'm publishing a PDF version of those slides here. Although I
have been delayed, I will be publishing parts 2 and 3 of the Behavioral
Information Security introduction which will provide additional detail
not found in the slides.
