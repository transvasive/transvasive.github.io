*Update:* while the video is no longer available on Vimeo, two copies
are available on YouTube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLW617T45IA)
and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPBBuPI5tOg).

[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/) has posted video from [my
talk](http://2011.appsecusa.org/talks.html#bsm) at [AppSec USA
2011](http://2011.appsecusa.org/). I haven't yet built up the nerve to
watch it yet (who likes to watch themselves?), so I can't say how good
it is, but hopefully it is interesting and informative. *Update:* it
seems the video is just slides & audio -- which is probably a good
thing. *Second Update:* I've been told I do appear in the video -- I
probably should watch more of it before updating.

I encourage you to peruse the talks list and watch the talks you may
have missed (if you were able to attend), or anything that looks
interesting (if you were not). This was my first experience with OWASP,
and I have to say I was impressed by both the openness and the
professionalism. Thanks to everyone in OWASP MSP who helped make AppSec
2011 a great success!
