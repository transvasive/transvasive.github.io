I spoke today (May 7, 2012) at
[SIRACon](https://www.societyinforisk.org/posts/2012/Mar/siracon-2012/),
the first ever conference of the Society of Information Risk Analysts.
Here is the description I submitted for the talk -- it is fairly close
to the final product:

*Effective, established Risk Management practices fall into two major
categories: management of risk due to accidental damage (safety) and
management of risk due to threats (protection). This talk will present
the case that these are two distinct methodologies, and all information
risk management should be divided into protection functions (like the
Secret Service) and safety functions (like the Aviation Industry),
staffed by different people if possible, due to the differences in
approach, available data, threat behavior, and the cognitive biases of
the risk analysts themselves.*

I've uploaded copies of the talk to my site: [Organizing Risk Management
Programs, Or, What I learned from the Aviation Industry and the US
Secret Service](/assets/orm-siracon-20120507.pdf).

I really enjoyed the day's talks, and appreciated all the different
perspectives, they all help with our still-immature business of
information risk analysis and information risk management.

I believe there will also be a video of my talk as well, I'll post a
link to that once it becomes available.
