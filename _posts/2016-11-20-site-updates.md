Today I completed some long overdue maintenance for
[transvasive.com](/) -- a number of links were broken due to a
prior migration, and general churning of the internet. All links have
been fixed, except for links that have permanently broken, which were
left as-is for posterity. All assets stored locally on the site are
working, please contact me if you find issues.
