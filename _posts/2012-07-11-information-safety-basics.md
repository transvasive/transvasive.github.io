I recently gave a short presentation at the [SkillShare Fair at
CoCo](https://web.archive.org/web/20150528153558/http://cocomsp.com/2012/06/skillshare-fair/), where
I spend time working and writing. I pitched it as "The top 4 things you
can do to keep your computer safe and secure." Although the group
attending was small, I had a great time, and learned from the
participants. It was a test run for a class I'm developing to teach
basic computer safety, blending both my experiences giving security
advice to friends & family and my concept of [Information
Safety]({% post_url 2012-05-07-siracon %}).

[Here is a copy of the slides I used](/assets/safety-skillshare-20120622.pdf). I
mentioned specific products in my talk, since they're representative of
the solutions I like for the typical risks most computer users face --
those are listed below.
